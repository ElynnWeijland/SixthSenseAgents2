Imagine you are a sales manager at Contoso, a multinational retail company that sells outdoor equipment. 🏕️ You need to analyze sales data to find trends, understand customer preferences, and make informed business decisions. To help you, Contoso has developed a conversational agent that can answer questions about your sales data. 💬📈

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- 🛠️ Build an agent app using Azure AI Agent Service.
- 🔍 Explore its tools.
- 📜 Effectively use instructions to guide the LLM.

After the basic workshop we will guide you to continue enhancing your agent with more advanced features, such as:
- 🚀 Expand the agent's capabilities beyond basic conversational tasks.
- 🧠 Integrate advanced AI features such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making.
- 🔗 Connect the agent to external APIs and data sources for enriched functionality.
- 📊 Enable the agent to generate visualizations and actionable insights from datasets.
- 🤝 Incorporate multi-agent collaboration to solve intricate business challenges.
- 🌐 Leverage Azure AI services to scale and enhance the agent's performance.

# SixthSenseAgents2 — Incident Detection Agent

This repository contains an agent that receives monitoring availability alerts and raises incidents in Slack.

What is included
- `src/workshop/incident_detection_agent.py` — core agent implementation.
- `src/workshop/main.py` — trigger script that calls the agent (guards `utils` import when Azure SDKs are absent).
- `incident_detection_agent.py` — top-level wrapper to load the implementation for tests and top-level imports.
- `tests/` — unit tests that mock Slack interactions.
- `instructions/` — usage and testing READMEs.
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies.
- `.env.example` — example env variables.

Quick start (using export)
1. Create & activate a venv (optional):
   - python3 -m venv .venv
   - source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install deps:
   - python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   - python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Export env variables:
   - export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-...your-token..."
   - export SLACK_CHANNEL="#incidents"

4. Run the agent trigger:
   - python3 src/workshop/main.py

5. Run tests:
   - pytest -q

Notes
- `main.py` uses a guarded import for `utils` to allow running without Azure SDKs installed.
- Tests use `asyncio.run(...)` to run the async Slack function synchronously and monkeypatch the implementation's Slack client to avoid external calls.
- Do not commit real tokens. Use `export` or a local `.env` file and keep it out of version control.
