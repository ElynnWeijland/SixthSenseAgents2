# Updated Workflow Order - Report Agent FIRST, Then Benefits Agent

## ✅ Changes Implemented

The multi-agent workflow has been reorganized to ensure:
1. **Report Agent sends to Slack FIRST** (with full resolution details)
2. **Benefits Agent sends to Slack SECOND** (referencing the same ticket ID)
3. **Both messages include the same Ticket ID** for clear correlation

## New Workflow Order

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: Resolution Agent                            │
│ - Analyzes the incident                             │
│ - Attempts automated resolution                     │
│ - Returns resolution result                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: Report Agent (SENDS FIRST) ✅                │
│ - Creates incident ticket with resolution           │
│ - Generates Ticket ID: INC-20240613-001             │
│ - SENDS TO SLACK immediately                        │
│ - Ticket ID extracted and passed to next step       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 3: Benefits Agent (SENDS SECOND) ✅             │
│ - Receives Ticket ID from previous step             │
│ - Calculates financial impact                       │
│ - SENDS TO SLACK with Ticket ID reference           │
│ - Links to the ticket sent in Step 2                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Ticket ID Extraction (main.py)

```python
# Extract ticket ID from Report Agent output
ticket_id_match = re.search(r'(INC-\d{8}-\d{3})', ticket_result)
if ticket_id_match:
    ticket_id = ticket_id_match.group(1)
    print(f"Extracted Ticket ID: {ticket_id}")
```

### 2. Ticket ID Passed to Benefits Agent (main.py)

```python
benefits_query = f"""
Please calculate the financial benefits:

Ticket ID: {ticket_id}  <-- INCLUDED IN PROMPT
Original Problem: {incident_description}
...

IMPORTANT: Include Ticket ID "{ticket_id}" in your Slack message
"""
```

### 3. Ticket ID in Benefits Slack Message (benefits_agent.py)

```python
# Add ticket ID reference if provided
if ticket_id:
    blocks.append({
        "type": "section",
        "text": {
            "type": "mrkdwn",
            "text": f"🎫 *Related Ticket:* `{ticket_id}`"
        }
    })
```

### 4. Updated Agent Prompts

**base_prompt_ticketing_agent.txt**:
- Explicit instruction to send to Slack immediately
- Includes resolution details in ticket

**base_prompt_benefit_agent.txt**:
- Updated to include ticket_id in Slack message
- Emphasizes linking to the related ticket

## Test Results

### Test Run Output

```bash
STEP 1: RESOLUTION AGENT - Diagnosing and Resolving Issue
✅ Resolution completed

STEP 2: REPORT AGENT - Creating Ticket with Resolution & Sending to Slack
Executing function: async_send_to_slack
✅ Ticket ID: INC-20240613-001
✅ Extracted Ticket ID: INC-20240613-001

STEP 3: BENEFITS AGENT - Calculating Financial Impact & Sending to Slack
Ticket ID: INC-20240613-001 (received from previous step)
Executing function: async_send_benefits_to_slack
✅ Benefits sent to Slack successfully
```

### Verification Checklist

- ✅ Report Agent runs BEFORE Benefits Agent
- ✅ Report Agent sends to Slack FIRST
- ✅ Ticket ID is generated (INC-20240613-001)
- ✅ Ticket ID is extracted successfully
- ✅ Ticket ID is passed to Benefits Agent
- ✅ Benefits Agent includes Ticket ID in Slack message

- ✅ Slack messages appear in correct order

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Chronological Flow**

   - Natural reading order in Slack

### 2. **Clear Linking**

   - Easy to correlate incident with its financial impact
   - Searchable by ticket ID in Slack

### 3. **Complete Context First**
   - Technical team sees incident details immediately
   - Resolution status available before benefits
   - Management can understand context before seeing ROI

### 4. **Audit Trail**
   - Clear sequence of events
   - Ticket created before benefits calculated
   - Proper incident management workflow

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed! The workflow order is controlled in `main.py` and will work with existing `.env` settings:

```bash

SLACK_CHANNEL=#incidents
```

## Files Modified

1. **main.py**:
   - Swapped Steps 2 and 3
   - Added ticket ID extraction logic
   - Passes ticket ID to Benefits Agent

2. **benefits_agent.py**:
   - Added `ticket_id` parameter to `async_send_benefits_to_slack()`
   - Displays ticket ID prominently in Slack message

3. **base_prompt_benefit_agent.txt**:
   - Updated to emphasize including ticket ID
   - Mentions linking to related ticket

4. **base_prompt_ticketing_agent.txt**:
   - Already updated to send to Slack immediately
   - Includes resolution details

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Threaded Replies**: Make benefits message a thread reply to ticket message
2. **Emoji Status**: Add 💰 reaction to ticket message when benefits calculated
3. **Summary Thread**: Create a summary thread with both messages
4. **Ticket Updates**: Allow updating ticket with benefits info
5. **Link Buttons**: Add "View Benefits" button to ticket message

## Conclusion

The workflow now operates in the correct order:
1. ✅ **Ticket created and sent to Slack FIRST**
2. ✅ **Benefits calculated and sent to Slack SECOND**
3. ✅ **Both messages linked by Ticket ID**

This provides stakeholders with complete incident context in chronological order, with clear linking between the technical ticket and business impact analysis.
