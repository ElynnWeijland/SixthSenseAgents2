# Build your first agent with Azure AI Agent Service

## Introduction

Imagine you are a sales manager at Contoso, a multinational retail company that sells outdoor equipment. You need to analyze sales data to find trends, understand customer preferences, and make informed business decisions. To help you, Contoso has developed a conversational agent that can answer questions about your sales data.

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the Python SDK. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## What you will learn

By the end of this workshop, you will learn to build an agent app using Azure AI Agent Service, explore its tools, and effectively use instructions to guide the LLM.
